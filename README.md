## Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
Concepts on Generative Adversarial Networks with the modelâ€™s inventor, Ian Goodfellow, Implementing a Deep Convolutional GAN(DCGAN). Its 
a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.
- Project19 - GAN on MNIST dataset
- Project20 - DCGAN on SVHN dataset
- Project21 - CycleGAN for Image to Image transformation
- Project22 - Use a deep convolutional GAN to generate completely new images of human faces
