# Introduction to Deep Learning
# Neural network (NN)
- Create NN using algorithms like gradient descent, backpropagation to train the model with python
- Project1: To predict Student Admission based on UCLA students GRE,GPA,Rank
- Project2: To predict Bike-sharing patterns on a given day
# Sentiment Analysis 
- Project3: To evaluate movie reviews
# Pytorch
# Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
- Create CNN to build an autoencoder, a network architecture used for image compression and denoising using PyTorch. 
- Project4: Classify dog breeds in pictures
# Recurrent neural network (RNN) 
- Combain with word embeddings that can generate new text, character by character. 
- Project5: Generate new TV scripts from provided existing scripts
# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Implement GAN Using Cycle GAN 
- Project6: Use a deep convolutional GAN to generate completely new images of human faces
# Deploying machine learning models on a cloud 
- Monitor using PyTorch and Amazon's SageMaker. 
- Project7: Deploy PyTorch sentiment analysis model and create a gateway for accessing this model from a website
