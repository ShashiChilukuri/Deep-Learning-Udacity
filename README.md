# Deep-Learning-Udacity
- Introduction to Deep Learning
- Create Neural network using algorithms like gradient descent, backpropagation to train the model with python and use Sentiment Analysis to evaluate and validate model. Project1: To predict Bike-sharing patterns on a given day
- Create convolutional networks to build an autoencoder, a network architecture used for image compression and denoising using PyTorch. Project2: Classify dog breeds in pictures
- Create recurrent neural network and combain with word embeddings that can generate new text, character by character. Project3: Generate new TV scripts from provided, existing scripts
- Implement Generative Adversarial Networks for various tasks using Cycle GAN. Project4: Use a deep convolutional GAN to generate completely new images of human faces
- Deploying machine learning models on a cloud and monitor using PyTorch and Amazon's SageMaker. Project5: Deploy PyTorch sentiment analysis model and create a gateway for accessing this model from a website
